I first heard her singing Follow Your Arrow on an awards show and I really liked it. That was what prompted me to buy her album.  Her songs are fun, catchy, and not too twangy. My daughter, who is not a country music fan, also really likes Kacey Musgraves.  Her vocals seem effortless. We look forward to purchasing her next album as well.	2015-08-31

You’d be hard pressed to think of anyone who’s done more to promote contemporary piano composition, particularly that in the “minimalist” vein, than the Dutch performer, Jeroen Van Veen. His protean efforts have yielded a wide range of voluminous recordings, all expertly performed in an exciting range of styles.<br /><br />It’s not surprising, then, that he’s used his encyclopedic knowledge to also create a 5-disc offering of his own compositions, all excellent and the whole collection a listening delight. While it’s hard to briefly comment on so many CD’s, suffice it to say that the first three discs are openly minimalist in their origins and are hypnotic in their appeal, some cuts meditative while others will want to make you get up and dance (yes, I did). The range is delicious, including some engaging uses of prepared pianos, carillon, tape and organ. The fourth disc takes off in some unexpected directions, including a fascinating essay on the four elements and one of my favorites, “Repeating History,” a thrilling mash-up of fragments of classical compositions to which minimalist music is indebted, knowingly or not, and all knitted together seamlessly with Van Veen’s compositional threads. The last CD is NLXL, inspired by the aerial photography of Holland by Karel Tomei. There’s a great video (viewable on YouTube) of Van Veen and his wife, Sandra, performing it with huge projections of the photos behind them. I find this format more effective for the piece and while the Van Veens use a wide range of interesting techniques to accompany their two pianos (including ambient sounds), some themes overstay their welcome a bit for me without the visuals.<br /><br />So, a LOT of music to enjoy from a composer/performer of great passions and a lively imagination. Definitely worth exploring!	2015-08-31

Super love song.<br />3. Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Keep On The Sunny Side. Good song, I think Gene Watson covered it on the Convoy soundtrack.<br />4. Rosanne Cash. Girl From The North Country. Dylan song well interpreted.<br />5. The Band. Long Black Veil. This song's rather depressing!<br />6. The Flying Burrito Brothers. Wild Horses. Jagger/Richard song, it's good.<br />7. Gene Clark. For A Spanish Guitar. Fantastic vocals and acoustic guitar playing, one of his best ever recordings.<br />8. The Louvin Brothers. The Christian Life. I like the song, covered by The Byrds for their 1968 album Sweetheart Of The Rodeo.<br />9. Bobbie Gentry. Ode To Billie Joe. Hauntingly fascinating song of love and loss.<br />10. Lucinda Williams. OK song.<br />11. Kitty Wells. It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels. 1950s Country is not for me.<br />12. Nanci Griffith. Lone Star State Of Mind. Up-tempo positive lyrics.<br />13. Patsy Cline. I Fall To Pieces. See Kitty Wells.<br />14. Merle Haggard. Sing Me Back Home. Strong vocals and message.<br />15. Nitty Gritty Band. Wreck On The Highway Not the happiest song.<br />16. Jerry Lee Lewis. Waiting For A Train. Jimmie Rogers song which Jerry makes his own, less than 2 minutes, but it's superb.<br />17. Slim Whitman. Tumbling Tumbleweeds. Again see Kitty Wells.<br />18. Glen Campbell. Rhinestone Cowboy. Classic 1970s Country/Pop at it's best.<br />19. Hank Williams. I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry. I wish the compiler had chosen I Saw The Light.<br />To confirm it's all original artists and recordings and there's enough diversity to stimulate discussion about what's good Country and what is not!	2015-08-31

I liked them so much as cherri bomb, they lost that haunting effect in their previous albums, I didn't like the genre change, the music is good it just not like their other songs. I hope the next album blows them out of the park. There first 2 albums were addicting, I listened to them all the time, but this album is a bit lighter but it just not the same. I loved cherri bomb before Julia pierce left the group, and all of it changed from their band name to the record label. They are still good and I hope to see that old side from cherri bomb again, I loved them instantly when I heard the album this is the end of control, I was hooked from the first song to the end, I listened to the album daily and I want to see the cherri bomb that I fell in love with.	2015-08-31

As 50 year old, it's unrealistic to expect the same kind of songs to come from Dr. Dre.  He has evolved as a producer and artist, and Compton embodies this perfectly. Even the tracks on here that would be considered &#34;weak&#34;, still tower over the mainstream filth regularly heard on the Radio.	2015-08-31

My wife said she felt like they didn't do anything super original in hip hop and I said &#34;They did, but they did it when this album came out and everyone else has copied it.&#34;  Yet this album still stands out as an amazing record.  I find the use of kung fu film soundtracks especially refreshing.  I also enjoy how the RZA seems unconcerned as to whether or not his samples are in the same key.  And yet, it doesn't sound atonal or out of place.  The lyrics and hooks are catchy with funny moments, tragic moments, powerful moments, and it bridges the gaps in between.  This album is a masterful work of art.	2015-08-31

Here in early Alice Cooper these vague and hazy, psychedelically removed and thoughtful, deeply depressing songs, tuneful, take shape. Occasionally tuneful, as &#34;Shoe Salesman&#34; best qualifies.

Laura's music is something I am so grateful to know about, and that's an understatement. I first knew of &#34;Green Garden&#34;, loved it, then fell off the radar with Laura for a bit and didn't think to listen in to more of her music. She came to me during a time of great need, her music is perfect to cry and laugh to, and really nice if you just want to sing! Got the regular album off Amazon, bought this version too, immediately, just because I knew it would come in handy. The orchestra adds another theatrical and majestic element to the album; I didn't even know it was possible for the music to be that much more beautiful. Now I can say with assuredness that the live &#34;Green Garden&#34; on this album is my number one Laura track, though every song she's created gives EVERY other artist a run for their money...hopefully I can see her in concert one day, thanks Laura Mvula for giving the world this gift!	2015-08-31

US	41188802	RLYSO5LXR255T	B00ZZ8P8PY	432701672	Professional Rapper	Music	5	0	0	N	Y	Good stuff	I tend to listen to all genres of music,  (never really got into Country though) and while I don't listen to a lot of different Rap/Hip Hop artists, I do really enjoy Lil Dicky's take on rap.  As with most of his fans I stumbled upon him on Facebook via YouTube when someone posted some of his first music videos.  Then of course followed his page and kept an eye on his kickstarter.  With things like YouTube, and Pandora internet radio and the like I hardly buy CDs anymore, but when it comes to new artists, or long time favorite artists, I'll shell out the money and support them by buying their albums.<br /><br />So to actually review the album after a few listens I'd have to say I really enjoy most of the tracks.  Only guest artist I was familiar with was Snoop Dogg (like I said I don't listen to a lot of rap/hip hop) the others seemed great too, and fit in nicely.  I might not pop this in the player every day, but when I want to get the Cadillac pumping with some bass this CD does the trick.  A lot of catchy tunes and some funny tracks (Pillow Talk is pretty funny)<br /><br />If you're on the fence about it, just check out all the YouTube videos, heck I'm sure most of the album is on there by now.	2015-08-31

But let me open a can of worms by saying, &#34;why buy this or any music when you can stream it on Prime or Spotify?  Not that I don't support the purchase of music - I do - wholeheartedly in fact.  But the music business has devalued music to such an extent that we can now play any and all music whenever we want - and not just on our phones but in our living rooms through our great stereo systems.  Maybe they aren't on our hard drives or in our CD players (and who uses one of those these days?) but my point being that the artists make less than $.003 cents per play from streaming.  So let's put that in perspective - 100,000 paid downloads puts about $50K in the pockets of the artist or label.  That same number of streams puts $300 in their pockets.  You read that right!  $300.00!  Who the hell can survive on that kind of income???  So how and why have we, the music buying public, allowed this to happen knowing that soon all we'll have to listen to is music that &#34;was&#34; made and not much that is new?  The only bands/artists that will survive are those who can tour and fill stadiums while basically giving away their music as a loss leader to get you to buy tickets to their shows.  Do you know how many artists will be driven from this business simply because they don't fit that mold?  Try 95%!  We have devalued music to such an extent that it's basically now free.  And so marks the end of the music business, the end of great music, the end of distribution and labels.  Technology killed the rock star!  And we are letting it happen.  Well done world!	2015-08-31

Don't get me wrong. I'm no prude. I love comedy routines that get dirty, crude, or otherwise foul in various ways. For example anything Amy Schumer says puts me in hysterics. But there is something amazing about how Gaffigan makes his routines as funny as his piers without drifting away from mostly clean jokes about ordinary life. Ellen Degeneres does her stand up in much the same way, without getting dirty and sticking to topics that just about everyone can personally relate to.<br /><br />If you're a parent or married or both then there is virtually nothing Jim Gaffigan says in his routines that you won't understand and relate to on a personal level. The man is just funny.<br /><br />King Baby is no exception to the &#34;Gaffigan is funny&#34; rule. It's a great set that he recorded in Austin, TX. Give it a try.	2015-08-31

No weak or annoying tracks to skip over and as being an album lover first and foremost I can appreciate the hard work they put into this project. Although I have and will listen to the full spectrum of music genres, my true loves are hard rock and metal and I've had this album since the week it came out, but just recently realized how much play it gets in my rotation and considering my CD collection is approaching the 3,000 album mark, I'd say that's pretty high praise! As a bonus, it's one of the better album covers and the vinyl which I also own is man cave essential. : )	2015-08-31

He brings lean, taut interpretations to these warhorses, interpretations that eschew All Teh Feelz, and yet which retain their beauty; this is the first time I've ever heard the Sixth Symphony sound like a &#34;symphony,&#34; and not a limp tone poem.  There are better individual performances of this or that symphony, but for a complete set, you can't do better than Szell and the Clevelanders.	2015-08-31

Hugo von Hofmannsthal's libretto, apr&egrave;s the ancient Greek dramatists, approaches the bizarre, for which Richard Strauss composed some of his most intricate music; the orchestration of &#34;Die &auml;gyptische Helena&#34; (1928) is undeniably brilliant, even according to the exalted standard of this composer.<br /><br />The cast is headed by Dame Gwyneth Jones, Matti Kastu, and Barbara Hendricks.  Miss Hendricks had one of the most beautiful voices before the public.  Not so, the controversial Dame Gwyneth:  Her singing was wild, off-pitch, harsh, and sometimes otherwise approximate.  Nevertheless, she was one of the towering singing-actresses of the last century.  As the legendarily-beautiful Helen of Troy, the soprano gives us one of her most disciplined studio recordings, and, as one can see from the cover photograph of her by Christian Steiner, Dame Gwyneth is a great beauty in her own right.  She is both precise and greatly exciting in this underrated score.<br /><br />The Finnish Heldentenor Kastu is excellent in a very demanding rôle.  Also in the cast is the distinguished Sir Willard White, and this is certainly one of the finest entries in Dor&aacute;ti's extensive discography.	2015-08-31

A solid collection of tracks assembled from a series of 10&#34; singles dating between 2012-2015.<br /><br />The six 10&#34; EPs themselves each contained one new A-side, one new cover tune, and one reworking of a song from Crenshaw's back catalogue.  The compilation contains only the six A-sides and six cover tunes, and none of the reworkings.  Also included is a bonus live track and a bonus demo dating back to sometime in the 90s.<br /><br />The new songs are all in Marshall's later mode: mid-tempo, sometimes downbeat, often with a wryly reflective point of view.  As well, the well-scrubbed pop hooks of thirty years ago are now much more subtle, and may take a few spins to sink in.  Unfortunately, the album isn't well served by putting all six of these originals back-to-back to lead off the album, as the tone of each of these six songs is somewhat similar, and it makes the album seem more monochromatic than it actually is.<br /><br />The seven covers (including the live bonus track) are a little more stylistically diverse, ranging from some rock-oriented Everly Brothers material to an achingly sincere &#34;Close To You&#34;.<br /><br />Overall, there's nothing absolutely revelatory about #392, but the album is still chock full of good songcraft performed with skill and passion.  If you're a long-term Crenshaw fan, this is a worthwhile purchase.  But if you're just getting in to Mr. Crenshaw's work?  I would say that there are other albums (Downtown, Life's Too Short, Marshall Crenshaw) that show him to greater advantage -- explore those ones first.	2015-08-31

This one is probably my least favorite and I think that is because it's a little different then her previous albums.  However, that being said, this album has grown on me the more I listen to it.  I find that there are certain songs I listen to over and over and a few I skip some times, but none that are horrible.  I highly recommend the deluxe version over the regular one.  The bonus songs are some of my favorite.  If you're a Kelly fan, buy it, you'll love it.	2015-08-31

This album is my next favorite after those. Being that I started to explore their music within the last few months, I haven't heard the albums from Terrapin Station on. The live music is far better in my opinion. Having said that, this album does sound better to me each time I listen to it. My particular favorites are St. Stephen, Doin that rag & Chinacat sunflower(which is far better live). The reissue comes with three pretty awesome live instrumental jams. If you are new to the Dead, I would suggest checking out the Live Dead album or the other two that I mentioned first.	2015-08-31

Me, I like his approach.  The sound is very good, too, despite the age of the recordings; the first and second violins are, I think, on opposite sides of the conductor, creating a wider, &#34;deeper&#34; stereo soundstage.<br /><br />In short, if you like Klemperer and you like Mahler, you'll like Klemperer's Mahler.  It's a shame he didn't take a shot at #6 as well.	2015-08-31

There's a few haters out there that want disturbed to put out the same old stuff yet at the same time change it up, which makes no sense, yet they succeed. There's a few heavy songs, a few quiter songs, even a love song. Yes a disturbed love song. There's alot of people hating about The song fire it up, because it's about weed, then these same people go listen to nirvana or some other strung out drug addicts. Not all disturbed songs need to be serious people, they're trying to break the mold, change it up. Plus it's a catchy song.<br />There's a few tracks where disturbed try to change it up, such as: the light, save our last goodbye, sound of silence, and fire it up. The rest of the songs are trying to make the older fans happy and stick to what they know the masses will enjoy. My biggest problem with this album is that disturbed has completely gone away from what made me love them in the first place, the awesome grunts and crazy way they said words, like &#34;so&#34; from the song voices. They have evolved and pretty much have done away with that this album except on maybe one track, maybe they are just more mature now, but kinda miss the immature side sometimes. Great album, new direction, grows on you the more you listen to it. Disturbed never seizes to amaze.	2015-08-31

I became an instant fan, and bought the album there expecting it to capture the same energy, and planning to buy her other album here on Amazon.  Sadly, the production on this CD is so smooth that if it didn't have several of the same songs I heard at the show, it would be hard to tell it's her singing.  This doesn't do her justice at all, so I'll hold off buying more recordings until someone gets a live show right, and stick with seeing her live in the meantime.	2015-08-31

I heard this while walking through my neighbourhood. Of course there is never a fixed time one should hear a music, it can be anywhere but I chose to do it while walking. I walked for about an hour and this played. Overall, the album has a solid sound but the tracks are just repetitive and boring. I can see fans of the band like this album a lot but there is not one single track that stands out, they're all stamped together. I may give this a second listen but I doubt I will say it is anything better than just ok. Best track? The last one, hands down.	2015-08-31

After watching Hugo I was looking forward to seeing this movie in the original form as much as possible. Ran into it on one of the streaming services and enjoyed it so much I wondered if it would be possible to have a copy of my own....<br /><br />Well, 5 bucks on Amazon did the trick - not only did I get the DVD of the restored movie, it came with the madcap and fun soundtrack with related music by the French group 'Air.' After watching the movie a few times, now I just have to listen to a few tracks of the music and I can imagine the visuals, it's an odd progression (or regression).<br /><br />A shout out to Scorsese for bringing this movie as well as greater awareness of the value of early cinema to the general public's attention in such a creative way. And for those who located the film parts and restored it, as well as for the wacky and fascinating way that Air aurally illustrated the sound palate to further enhance the imagination of those who view it.<br /><br />Whenever I unwillingly catch NPR droning on excitedly about stock market valuation, or Fox cunningly conning me into believing the latest thing I'm supposed to hate about people and the world, I can instead close my eyes and join those imaginative enough to see a trip to the moon back in a time when horses were the main mode of transport.	2015-08-31

This is an odd mix, but all tracks feature Johnny Hodges and Kenny Burrell.<br /><br />Here are the albums that comprise this set:<br />Tracks 1 through 7 is the album titled [[ASIN:B004114U5K Mess of Blues LP]] that  was recorded for Verve in NYC on September 4, 1963. The music is more on the mellow side with beautiful guitar lines from Burrell and those beautiful B3 notes from Davis with a wonderful combination of sustained and staccato notes. The drummer is Ed Shaughnessy who plays with taste and is a perfect fit for this ensemble. Of course, Hodges' trademark alto sax is the centerpiece of each track.<br /><br />Tracks 8 through 10 are from that album titled [[ASIN:B00Q50W5ZC Johnny Hodges & Wild Bill Davis Blue Rabbit]] that was originally recorded for Verve in NYC spanning two 1963 and two 1964 sessions.  These tracks are from 1963. May 15, 1963 features Hodges on alto, Ray Jackson on organ, Kenny Burrell on guitar, Wendell Marshall on bass and Bobby Donaldson on drums for I Let A Song Go Out Of My Heart and Tangerine. On May 17, for the song Creole Love Call the same line-up performs, except Jack Lesberg is the bassist.<br /><br />The remaining tracks are the album titled [[ASIN:B0002ZEWPM Stride Right]] that was recorded for Verve in NYC on January 14, 1966. The line-up is Hodges on alto, Earl Hines on piano and a rhythm section that includes Kenny Burrell on guitar (who adds a LOT), Richard Davis on bass and Joe Marshall on drums.	2015-08-31

Of the more than 30 commercial recordings of the Ring I have heard, this one is undoubtedly at the bottom of the list, even over the Haitink Ring from the 1980s.  Others have mentioned the bad sonics with which I concur.  I also found the singing underwhelming, particularly the Wotan and the Hagen.  Both seem to lack energy and intensity in their performance.  I also found the extra DVDs rather boring.  The only reason I give this two stars is that it does occasionally have its moments of pure beauty, mostly in the orchestra parts.  If you are looking for a ring, skip this one.  Better ones abound!	2015-08-31

Feral is a pretty strong word, Pandolfo has it in spades, and despite the Germanic emotional restraint in this music, there's no mistaking it here.  Ranging from gossamer delicacy (Andante BWV 1027) to fiercely fast ornamentation (Allegro, BWV 1028) to a wonderful sense of tumbling pell mell onto home base (same movement, BWV 1028), there is a strong sense of something wild in his perfomance.<br /><br />Add to that the perfect communication between him and H&uuml;nninger, picking up on each other's declamation and ornamentation, the clear un-French-ness, and the top notch balance (helpfully engineered, I suspect, in the studio) between them, and the joys of this release are myriad.	2015-08-31

As may have been expected, the production is thin and the songwriting strangely lacking.  The only really good song on the album is &#34;When All is Said and Done&#34;, which has an appropriately melancholy tone to it.  What is most strange is the complete absence of songs with Kevin Raleigh on lead vocals.  He does handle back up vocals fine, but his fine pop songwriting is sorely missed.	2015-08-31

Yes, &#34;The Four Temperaments&#34; (and &#34;The Inextinguishable&#34;) are rather underdone, but they're simply bursting with energy when compared to Sakari Oramo's new recordings on the Bis label. I still prefer Douglas Bostock to Gilbert overall in the complete symphonies, but when hearing all six Gilbert does have his moments. Overall, however, the performances I turn to the most often are Herbert Blomstedt's magnificent (second) Nielsen cycle on Decca with the San Francisco Symphony.<br /><br />Where Gilbert really does shine is in his conducting of the concertos. Here, it seems that he really comes to life, and by and large he has soloists who are superior to those that Bostock used. Thus, if you want a complete set of all the symphonies and concertos by one conductor and don't really case if the symphony performances aren't the best, this is an OK set...certainly better as a whole than I would have expected.	2015-08-31

Quincy Jones’ comment, “I can hear greatness sometimes before the musicians themselves know they have it,” expresses all about this package. Even at the Spire session, seven years before the Turf Club dates, Wes had filled in allotted small spaces with his unique thumb plucking single-tone. Wes, as-yet undiscovered, is genuinely enjoying his play with friends getting along well in his daily milieu. You won’t discern Wes’s signature orchestration of solo yet in this Turf Club live, that is opening with single note choruses before unleashing choruses of octaves and finalizing with choruses of cords. His solo is a single note burn of the highest order, imaginative and joyful, which is all purely hard-bop-inspired.<br /><br />His tone is distinguishably warm, his phrasing is uncannily fluid, and above all, his tempo is blazingly fast. Listen to Wes’s guitar with stunning speed in “Brazil,” “My Heart Stood Still,” and “Caravan.” Wes supports Pookie Johnson’s ideas with his tender solo. Blowing chord melodies on “Caravan,” and “Six Bridges To Cross” is a foretell of things to come. It is simmering, steaming with confidence and force. Much more striking fact is the consistency with his play throughout the album. “I Should Care,” where other band members lay out, is truly fascinating. Restful guitar sound is nicely matching with Andrews’ firm voicing. On “Ralph’s New Blues” Wes takes up a bass. Buddy’s episode of soothing Wes, who complains of rope-like thickness of bass strings, is heartwarming. Buddy said, “do something good at least you can take it.” Only an elder person within a family could say like this. As a result, Wes left us a good walking bass solo.<br /><br />Three tracks from the Missile Lounge on Oct. 22. ’58, make us easily imagine Cannonball Adderley’s and Orrin Keepnews’ excitement when they hear their play at the first time eleven months later. A photographer Duncan Schiedt vividly reports witnessing these historical moments in the inserted booklet. “Soft Winds” is a rare recording to capture Melvin Rhyne playing a piano. Wes is galloping with octaves up and down following his single-note solo on “Soft Winds.” A chase with Richie Crabtree is fantastic. On “Robbin’s Nest,” he is heading into choruses of slick octave work and then finishing off his solo with brilliant chord soloing. Buddy Montgomery confirms to Joseph Woodard in the same booklet that guitar as a lead, melodic instrument was a new idea and unusual sound at that time. They played basically bebop.<br /><br />As to his four compositions collected in this album, “Leila,” “Far Wes,” and “Wes’ Tune” are recorded again for “Montgomeryland (Pacific, ’58,)” which are compiled and re-issued as “Bigginings (BN-LA531-H2)” from Blue Note. For “Leila,” I take this columbia version, which features Buddy’s precise piano solo. A pacific version of “Far Wes” is extended to nearly double length of this columbia version. A pacific version provides fairly spaces for Harold Land and Buddy after Wes. They all perform emotionally imaginative play. I choose a pacific version for these solo. “Wes’ Tune” is compactly rearranged in a pacific version. However, I prefer an enthusiastic play at the Turf Club. The fourth composition “Blues” is very close with the title tune of “Movin’ Wes (Verve, ’64.)” Wes might developed a concept of this tune into “Movin’ Wes” later.<br /><br />Klabin and Feldman reveal having more Wes materials for their future release to Jazz Times. They won’tfail us the next time also.fail us the next time also.	2015-08-31

US	47449722	R3CW64D2EPS3HA	B0021BO412	964527365	Maybe I'm Dreaming	Music	5	3	3	N	N	A delightful early album from Owl City -- whimsical, soothing, and fun	I was first introduced to Owl City by way of my brother, who has a knack for finding offbeat but wonderful musicians to follow.  I was further intrigued when Owl City's hit song &#34;Fireflies&#34; became popular (and was sampled in one of &#34;Weird Al&#34; Yankovic's polka medleys -- I end up liking a lot of songs due to Al's influence...).  To call Owl City a &#34;band&#34; is a bit of a misnomer, as it's mostly one guy and a synthesizer -- &#34;music project&#34; is the term most people use -- but all the same I was delighted to discover that Adam Young's music didn't adhere to the standards of modern pop music, nor was it the harsh and repetitive stuff people come to expect from electronic acts such as Daft Punk.  It's unique, delightful, and both lively and soothing to the ear.<br /><br />&#34;Maybe I'm Dreaming&#34; is Owl City's first album, and it has a unique and whimsical sound to it that I love.  And while his more recent hits, such as &#34;Fireflies,&#34; &#34;Good Time,&#34; and &#34;When Can I See You Again?&#34; might be more popular, it's hard to match the charm of his early album.<br /><br />&#34;Maybe I'm Dreaming&#34; is an example of Owl City's music before it became influenced by popular artists (and before Adam Young would begin incorporating guest stars).  His music feels almost like it comes out of one of Nintendo's video games -- electronic but light and playful, hitting a nice balance between soothing and lively.  And his lyrics, while puzzling and even nonsensical at times, are clever and equally playful, painting fantastic dreamscapes for the listener.  Though if you listen closely there are some odd and even shocking lyrics, such as &#34;colors in my veins&#34; and &#34;smell of the crime scenes.&#34;  Um... what?<br /><br />It's difficult to pick a favorite song from this collection, but &#34;On the Wing,&#34; &#34;Sky Diver,&#34; and &#34;West Coast Friendship&#34; are strong contenders.  All are beautifully done, with fun and playful lyrics that paint vivid pictures.  &#34;Sky Diver&#34; is perhaps the most straightforward one of these, a simple song about a skydiver's experience leaping from a plane, though &#34;West Coast Friendship&#34; is pretty obviously about a man's journey to California to visit friends.  Whether the lyrics are straightforward or obtuse, however, they're still a joy to listen to.<br /><br />The only song on the album I didn't enjoy was &#34;Dear Vienna,&#34; which has some harsher, almost industrial-sounding effects in the music that jarred me out of the song.  I applaud Young for experimenting and trying out something different, but I didn't like this song as well, and it's probably my least favorite from the album.<br /><br />A delightful first album from a favorite musician, &#34;Maybe I'm Dreaming&#34; is a great album for easy listening, and if you like electronic music, video game music, or just something pleasing to the ear, I highly recommend it.  It's also a good example of Owl City's early work, before Adam Young became popular and started drifting more toward a mainstream sound.lyrics that paint vivid pictures.  &#34;Sky Diver&#34; is perhaps the most straightforward one of these, a simple song about a skydiver's experience leaping from a plane, though &#34;West Coast Friendship&#34; is pretty obviously about a man's journey to California to visit friends.

His tender approach and light finger-work, combined with a heartfelt insight, constitute the ingredients of memorable interpretations as testified in the previous three volumes of this series plus the benchmark recording of the 24 Preludes. Here, the French-Canadian virtuoso offers a spectacular, witty and graceful traversal of waltzes added with a few nocturnes, all played on that marvellous Fazioli piano.<br /><br />This is a recording to listen to, time and again without getting bored. One can very simply tell why: the inspiration of a great pianist of today meets seductively and compellingly the confessions committed the beloved instrument by a great composer of the romantic era. Directness, simplicity, soaring and joy – these could be in short the main qualities of this recent release by Louis Lortie. Five stars!	2015-08-31

Billy Vaughn's 3 million dollar<br />LPs are part of this collection: Sail Along Silv'ry Moon, Blue Hawaii  and Theme From a Summer Place.  All of these spent over a year on<br />Billboard's Top LPs chart and all received Gold Record Awards. A  number of Billy's albums which were recorded in 1955, 56 and 57  were<br />recorded in Mono only. The LPs on CD 1 (Sweet Music and Memories  and Melodies in Gold) are in mono.  The others are in stereo.<br />There is one error on the Blue Hawaii LP  in this set: Hawaiian War Chant is not the original Dot album/single recording.  For some reason<br />compilers used a much later recording made for Japanese Victor in the 1970s.  This recording does not belong here  and certainly  does<br />not sound appropriate to the other songs in the Blue Hawaii collection.  It is great to finally have at least 16 of Billy's Dot albums on CD in<br />these very  reasonably priced sets.  The earliest albums are otherwise only available on the Bear Family boxed set.	2015-08-31

The first time I listened to it I though it was Steve Forbert singing, especially the guy started playing the harmonica. More &#34;Alive on Arrival&#34; than &#34;Jackrabbit Slim, but a definite Forbert vibe, unlike with unmistakable nod to Springsteen. But unlike Amazon's main editorial review, I don't hear &#34;Nebraska&#34; at all. Instead, many songs on this album have a distinct &#34;Greetings from Asbury Park&#34; sound to them. And as far as I'm concerned that's a very good thing!<br /><br />Marah has taken those influences and rocked things up a few of the songs (people have used the Replacements for comparison, but I lean more toward the Hold Steady as kindred musical spirits) and the results are mostly very good. I wasn't blown away by all of the songs. &#34;The Catfisherman&#34;, for example, sounds like a hackneyed attempt at being funky that just doesn't click. But when these songs DO click and fire, the melodies and energy are infectious. Overall, a most impressive album.	2015-08-31

That the result is a superb realization of Wagner's marathon meditation on art and society makes it essential for those who appreciate Wagner and for classical music lovers in general.<br /><br />The Vienna State Opera theater had been severely damaged late in World War II; the venerable venue didn't reopen until the autumn of 1955.  This production of Die Meistersinger was a part of that festival.  Because of the special nature of the occasion, the State Opera engaged the finest cast available and awarded the conducting duties to Fritz Reiner, who was molding the Chicago Symphony Orchestra into one of the world's great ensembles.<br /><br />Paul Schoffler is heard here at the right time in his career for the role of Hans Sachs: he has the skill and insight of experience, while the voice is still strong and supple.  There isn't any better Sachs on compact disc.<br /><br />Hans Beirer's Walther does not offer silvery tones, but his energy and shaping of phrases make for an engaging performance.<br /><br />The Eva of Irmgard Seefried might seem on the Gidget-y side early in the opera, but she matures fast and by the third act she projects a melting warmth.<br /><br />Erich Kunz not only sings the role of Beckmesser splendidly, he manages to inject a smidgen of sympathetic feeling for the character.<br /><br />The rest of the cast range from very good to better than that.<br /><br />Fritz Reiner sensitively and firmly frames this sprawling musical canvas.  From the nicely formed Prelude to the ensemble pieces, particularly the quintet in Act Three, he maintains a careful balance between the grand and the intimate.  His attention to detail and his pacing reveal the riches in the score while keeping the drama flowing.  If only Reiner had committed a Ring cycle to disc!  (There is a recording of Reiner conducting the San Francisco Opera in the second act of Die Walkure taken from a radio broadcast, as this was.  He was preparing Die Gotterdamerung for the Metropolitan Opera when he died in 1963).<br /><br />I have an earlier release of this recording, on another label, so I'll refer to Robert Levine's review in Classics Today for a judgment of the sound quality here:<br />&#34;The sound is Austrian Radio mono from 1955 but sounds 10 years younger–grand and able to cope with the big climaxes, clear in the ensembles, clean in quiet moments.&#34;  To which I'll add: the listener must make allowances for this being a live recording — dynamics are variable as the performers move about the stage, etc.  So, while this is not sonically sumptuous, it is good enough for the listener to enjoy a prime performance of a great opera.<br /><br />Other recordings of Reiner conducting Wagner in full-length performances are: Tristan und Isolde at Covent Garden with Lauritz Melchior and Kirsten Flagstad on various labels, the Naxos release probably having the best sound [[ASIN:B00004YYQL Tristan & Isolde]].  Tristan und Isolde at the Met with Ramon Vinay and Helen Traubel [[ASIN:B0030AEPY4 Richard Wagner: Tristan Und Isolde (Tristan and Isolde) [New York -- December 9, 1950: Helen Traubel, Blanche Thebom, Ramon Vinay, Sven Nilsson, Paul Schoeffler (Schoffler), Hugh Thompson, Leslie Chabay, Thomas Hayward, Lawrence Davidson; Fritz Reiner]]].

For some reason on the quieter songs/sections of songs there is a discernible low end rumble. It almost sounds like the CD was taken from a Quad LP. I noticed it alot during the first three songs and thought it might be attributable to the relative primitive original sound quality of these early Cummings era songs. But it turns up again later in the CD. Not a deal breaker but it is something you might want to be aware of.	2015-08-31

And after spending 57 minutes in the company of their lone Etta James entry &#34;Tell Mama...&#34; - you can’t help feeling that this CD compilation is just a little bit more special than all the others. Here is a proper little sweetheart of a release available to all good people for notta-lotta wonga. Here are the shimmy-shimmy details...<br /><br />US released May 2001 – &#34;Tell Mama: The Complete Muscle Shoals Recordings&#34; by ETTA JAMES on Universal/MCA/Chess 088 112 518-2 (Barcode 008811251826) is a 22-track CD compilation and plays out as follows (57:09 minutes):<br /><br />1. Tell Mama<br />2. I'd Rather Go Blind<br />3. Watch Dog<br />4. The Love Of My Mind<br />5. I'm Gonna Take What He's Got<br />6. The Same Rope<br />7. Security<br />8. Steal Away<br />9. My Mother In Law<br />10. Don't Lose Your Good Thing<br />11. It Hurts Me So Much<br />12. Just A Little Bit<br />Tracks 1 to 12 are the LP &#34;Tell Mama&#34; – released January 1968 in the USA on Cadet LP 802 (Mono) and Cadet LPS 802 (Stereo). Although the &#34;Tell Mama&#34; album was released in supposed 'Stereo' – Universal's tape research shows that true stereo mixes for Tracks 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 were never made - fake Stereo was used on the issued LP - so they've been replaced here with the true Mono mixes. Bearing that in mind - Tracks 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 12 are in STEREO – Tracks 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 are in MONO.<br /><br />BONUS TRACKS (all in Mono, only Mono Masters exist):<br />13. Do Right Woman, Do Right Man (recorded 30 Nov 1967)<br />14. You Took It (recorded 2 Aug 1968)<br />15. I Worship The Ground You Walk On (1968 USA 7&#34; single on Cadet 5606, B-side of &#34;I Got You Babe&#34;)<br />16. I Got You Babe (1968 USA 7&#34; single on Cadet 5606, A)<br />17. You Got It (recorded August 1968)<br />18. I've Gone Too Far (recorded August 1968 – Previously Unreleased)<br />19. Misty (recorded August 1968 – Previously Unreleased)<br />20. Almost Persuaded (1969 USA 7” single on Cadet 5630, A)<br />21. Fire (1968 USA 7&#34; single on Cadet 5620, B-side of &#34;You Got It&#34;)<br />22. Do Right Woman, Do Right Man (Alternate) (recorded 30 Nov 1967 – Previously Unreleased)<br /><br />This CD will allow fans to sequence the A&B-sides of four US 7&#34; singles using the following tracks:<br />1. Tell Mama [1] b/w I'd Rather Go Blind [2] (Nov 1967, Cadet 5578)<br />2. Security [7] b/w I'm Gonna Take What He's Got [5] (March 1968, Cadet 5594)<br />3. I Got You Babe [16] b/w I Worship The Ground You Walk On [15] (June 1968, Cadet 5606)<br />4. Almost Persuaded [20] b/w Steal Away [8] (Jan 1969, Cadet 5630)<br /><br />The four-way foldout inlay has new liner notes by LEE HILDEBRAND (it also reproduces the original Morry Roth LP liner notes) as well as track-by-track annotation. There are colour photos of Etta in the Studio with the seated horn section of James Mitchell, Charles Chalmers and Floyd Newman - another with the rest of the band – Calvin Scott, Billy Foster, Jimmy Ray Johnson and Albert Lowe, Jr. – and a final shot of an smiling Gene &#34;Bowlegs&#34; Miller with Producer and owner of Fames Studios – Rick Hall. It’s nicely done if not a tiny bit slight – but that cannot be said of the fabulous ERICK LABSON remasters. Labson has handled as many as 1000 remasters overt the decades including the vast majority of the huge Chess Records catalogue as well as prestigious Rock catalogues like Steppenwolf, Three Dog Night, Neil Diamond, Wishbone Ash and The Who (to name but a few). But his work here is gorgeous – especially on those stunning Stereo cuts.<br /><br />The LP is very much a product of the 60tsR&B times – fast-slow, fast-slow and so on. A fast belter opens proceedings with the Stereo take of &#34;Tell Mama&#34; putting hairs on your chest – which is followed by the magnificent ache of &#34;I'd Rather Go Blind&#34; (Christine McVie would almost make the song her own with Chicken Shack on Blue Horizon who covered it that year). Etta doesn't appreciate her jealous lover in &#34;Watch Dog&#34; as she tells us &#34;...I don't want no man of mine everywhere I go...he's right behind...he's like the FBI!” You on the other hand will love this groovy shimmy and shake dancer penned by Don Covay. Time for Ed Townshend's &#34;The Love Of My Man&#34; where Etta tells us he's the greatest chap in the whole wide world. Shortly after she’s telling us in uncomfortable sucker-mode that even though 'he beat on me and he cheat on me' her man's ok really because in private he can be so sweet (what a guy).<br /><br />The chipper Lloyd Webster/Leonard Caston number &#34;The Same Rope&#34; advises that if Etta's man leaves he maybe using that rope to hang himself when he realises what he's done (stunning audio on this especially in the rhythm section). She does a great job with Otis Redding's &#34;Security&#34; and the sexy arrangement she gives Jimmy Hughes' &#34;Steal Away&#34; is refreshing while still retaining the brilliance of that wicked original. Etta has a family itch she needs to scratch in the cautionary &#34;My Mother In Law&#34; where she tells us that she's &#34;...Sick and tired of your mother...always sticking her nose in my business...seems like I married her...instead of you...&#34; (oh dear). And on it goes to her slinky cover of Rosco Gordon's &#34;Just A Little Bit&#34; - a wicked hip-wiggler bound to put your arteritis out to pasture...<br /><br />The 10 bonus tracks offer three Previously Unreleased (18, 19 and 22) while her single-only cover of Sonny & Cher's &#34;I Got You Babe&#34; is Previously Unreleased on album. Unfortunately it's easy to hear why her cover of &#34;Misty&#34; was canned – its jazzy arrangement feels dated, out of place and just doesn’t suit her. Better is the boogie of &#34;You Took It&#34;, the Don Covay dancer &#34;You Got It&#34; and the chugging Clarence Carter funk of Willie Dixon's &#34;Fire&#34;.<br /><br />A wicked CD Reissue currently retailing at just over three quid from certain sellers. &#34;I'm on fire!

US	45787971	R20YHXBRZHOZOQ	B00006AW2G	344060343	Let It Bleed	Music	5	3	3	N	N	As essential as it gets	It alsmost seems foolish to write a review for an album that is SO essential, one you really need to own (and most of the people reading this probably own it anyway). It's a transitional album, the sound of the Brian Jones Stones making way for the Mick Taylor Stones. Jones and Taylor each play relatively minor roles here. Even Taylor's &#34;baptism by fire,&#34; throwing him into the deep end of the pool for the live set &#34;Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out,&#34; has been dwarfed by later live archive stuff like the &#34;Official Bootleg&#34; of &#34;The Brussels Affair&#34; as well as the Leeds, Marquee and Roundhouse concerts accompanying the &#34;deluxe&#34; reissue of &#34;Stick Fingers.&#34; That's where the new band was fully formed, where it became a great, howling, ferocious behemoth unequalled in the history of rock & roll. Consider the famous boast that opens &#34;Ya Ya's&#34;...&#34;The GREATEST rock & roll band in the world, The Rolling Stones...&#34; It's true, you know? The Beatles were a cultural phenomenon that could hardly be contained by the label of &#34;rock band.&#34; The Who were a force of nature, but they were never an &#34;everyman&#34; band unless you felt comfortable inside of Pete Townshend's head, dancing with his demons. No, it was and will always be The Stones...Keef, churning out precise, deliberate machine gun blasts of Chuck Berry riffs, Charlie holding it all together with his trademark bemused / bored stiff expression, Jagger and that rooster strut. I don't think the band fully knew where they were going during the &#34;Let It Bleed&#34; sessions. It was an exploration, a search for something bigger and bolder than what they had in the moment, even though they were kings of their particular hill. Compare &#34;With The Beatles&#34; and &#34;Revolver&#34;...same thing. &#34;Let It Bleed&#34; and what follwed was NOT &#34;better than&#34; anything from the Brian Jones prime years. It was different. It was a band evolving.<br /><br />Obviously,&#34;Gimme Shelter,&#34; &#34;Love In Vain,&#34; &#34;Midnight Rambler,&#34; and &#34;You Can't Always Get What You Want&#34; went on to become &#34;concert staples,&#34; with the &#34;Ya Ya's&#34; version of &#34;Rambler&#34; becoming &#34;definitive,&#34; but as I said above, maybe left in the dust by some of the tougher performances from the Taylor era that finally saw the light of day.<br /><br />For my tastes, Johnny Winter took ownershiop of the title track on his &#34;Still Alive And Well&#34; album. He just tapped a vein of sarcasm, ennui, humor, just SOMETHING that Mick & Keith glossed over by comparison.<br /><br />&#34;You Got The Silver&#34; finally saw a well-deserved rebirth in the &#34;Shine a Light&#34; film, and &#34;Monkey Man&#34; has been trotted out on stage a few times, too.<br /><br />There are NO &#34;disposable&#34; tracks on this one. All nine, all 43 minutes worth, this is as good as it gets. It's history that still rocks, still moves, still inspires.<br /><br />It's as essential as it gets, so...what are ya waiting for? If you own it, go listen to it, and if you don't, get it now.	2015-08-31

Expect the top notch vocals from Speed, amazing guitar and drum work that have been seen in albums past. I've been a fan since Natural Born Chaos but I enjoy all of their albums. Everything from Steelbath Suicide to Sworn to A Great Divide. Not that it makes my review better than anyone else's. This albums carries the intense, fast paced tunes from The Living Infinite, and kicks it up a notch. Some of the choruses are hauntingly beautiful. Gives me the goosebumps. Anywho, another awesome album from Soilwork. If you enjoyed their last album, I see no reason you won't enjoy this.	2015-08-31

Vogt has an Almaviva voice doing Lohengrin. Sort of like Juan Diego Florez sings Wagner. Taken for what it is, it is not entirely unlistenable. He has a sweet tone and phrases well. It's just not Kauffman. What I don't like are the abrupt cutoffs and hanging in the wind endings. You can't slice Wagner like you can Rossini. Just when you're flowing with the music , it jumps off a cliff or fades into the air. I would like  hear Vogt in the Bel Canto operas. I hope he essays other things than Wagner.	2015-08-31

Consequently, I was delighted when I discovered this &#34;two-fer&#34; CD!  Anyone who enjoys bluegrass music---with a bit of a modern touch---will like this CD!  &#34;Sandman&#34; was the follow-up album to, &#34;Southwest&#34;!

This recording will become my &#34;go to&#34; performance, and that's saying a lot since I have since the late 80's believed the DG Karajan/Vienna Philharmonic recording to be the definitive Verdi Requiem. The Muti/Chicago Symphony Orchestra performance is top notch and the recording technology can take some of the bows. A live performance can be a difficult process but the CSO/Resound label delivers the goods. The soloists and the chorus stand tall (sonically and technically) and the orchestra does a wonderful balancing act making it a A+ effort with A+ results. Bravo, Muti! and Bravo Verdi!

He had been hailed as \\""miraculously gifted . . . one of the most remarkable examples of the rarest talents one could hope to find\\"" by Cortot (his teacher) and had worked with the likes of Abbado", Muti, Barbirolli, Guilini and Gui before that fateful day in March 1974. Great expectations were confounded therein.<br /><br />This entire cycle was recorded over a period of a few weeks in the spring of 1970 in Torino. Dynamic's liner notes state that a tape recorder was stationed in the centre of the hall for the live recordings. In consequence," one hears the audience down to the last sniffle. \\""The piano is distant and can ring", bite, glare, and grate all at the same time. There's pitch distortion, wow, drop-outs," overloading.\\"" Name the malady - it's there. On my part"," I soon acclimatised to it. It sounds too atmospheric to be Plain Jane mono.<br /><br />Todd on naim.audio.com has written a superlative review in depth which I am going to summarise shamelessly since I agree with his viewpoint. When Beethoven calls for the \\""fast and furious\\""", Ciani responds in spades (the Appassionata is quite something). His effortless technique and lyricism enliven the set and command attention. Alas, barnstorming technique prevails over thought in many instances (the Hammerklavier being a prime example, and Ciani has little to say in Opus 111 beyond mere notes).  After a radiant opening to Opus 110, the pianist rushes his fences in the Allegro Molto that follows; boring it ain't but nor does it satisfy. Indeed, one could classify so many of these performances as being glorified sight-readings by a prodigy out to impress.<br /><br />If you're interested in superheated, speed-demon Beethoven, played by a He-Man of the keyboard, this set is for you - provided you can accept that its philosophical ordnance is underbaked. Ciani was in his late Twenties at the time so one can regard them as transitional readings rather than the terminus that they became. Warts and all, I'd rather listen to James Dean's Beethoven than any number of cycles from the likes of Brendel and Barenboim in their spinster ways. If nothing else, you won't be bored.n the terminus that they became.

Due to the increasing number of past heroes who make their come-backs", trying to re-live their past fame or to bring in some fresh bucks to pay the bills, I hesitated before picking up this album, bearing also in mind that his last attempt was not doing him any justice. But when I finally started listening to it, I was blown away.<br /><br />I have listened to Billy Idol from almost the start, when Rebel Yell and lots of other smash hits were rocking the dance floors. However, as an album, &#34;Whiplash smile&#34; has been my favorite up until now. This album stands out from the others. Many albums have their &#34;good ones&#34; and the &#34;not so good ones&#34;, but this is one of the few albums (regardless of artist) where I actually just let the entire album just run, and run, and run..  I am blown away of how he the a certain degree has updated to contemporary style while still applying a stronger Billy Idol signature than in a long time. I am actually surprised that lyrics and musicwise, we comes off as a more mature and humbled man, refreshingly honest about where he is in life and how he looks back. And at the same time he still keeps his integrity as a punk/rocker. This is not very easy to combine, but he actually pulls it off! -On every track! OK, some maybe better than others, but every track is more than good enough for me to listen to and enjoy. Some of the songs also amuse old fans with references to his old hits, and in particular &#34;Postcards from the past&#34; is entirely built on references to the past (thus the title). This is also something 9 out of 10 faded artists would want to try, but Billy Idol actually more than pulls it off, he really aced this song!<br /><br />I rate this album his best ever as a complete album.  It is a perfect come-back revenge, he is new, he is old, and very much alive. Introspective songs and a summary of the past, combined with refreshing rock music, starts off really cool, rocks a little bit, throws in some ballads that you believe, in contrast to many prior ones, and then the album rounds off with a fast, kick-ass punk/rock track to demonstrate the he still got it - and then he drops the mic!  Noww, THAT's how you do it!! Thank you, Idol!<br /><br />I hope not this is his last album, but if so, he did it in grace!	2015-08-31

The music on this dual CD was recorded on 22 January 1975 at Shinjuku Kohseinenkin Hall in Tokyo, 10 days before the Agharta/Pangaea concerts in Osaka on 1st February. The Tokyo performance was originally recorded as an FM radio broadcast to be aired only in Japan, and includes different material to the Osaka concerts.<br /><br />The band has the same line-up as Agharta/Pangea: Miles; two electric guitarists, Pete Cosey and Reggie Lucas; percussionist James Mtume Heath; young bass player Michael Henderson (who Miles stole from Stevie Wonder’s backing band!); Sonny Fortune on sax & flute, and drummer Al Foster.<br /><br />If you like Agharta/Pangea, you’re going to like this: the band is in the same raunchy jazz/funk groove. Much of the performance is dominated by high-energy interplay between Cosey and Lucas, and Miles’ contributions to the sound are often played through a wah-wah pedal. Throughout Miles’ electric-fusion period 1969-75 no two performances were the same but each had structure, guided by Miles as band director as the music unfolds. As on Agharta/Pangea it’s obvious that this band knows its business, but no-one knew in advance when the changes would happen or where the music would go.<br /><br />In a 2015 essay on Miles’ fusion/funk period, Angus Batey writes that the listener can best appreciate this music if s/he has “the ability to grasp the plan and understand the context for, and the nature of, these still shockingly futuristic and unequalled sounds…Miles and his 1975 band fusing jazz, rock and funk into a seamless, satisfying and richly rewarding whole”.<br /><br />If you don’t know the Agharta/Pangea concerts but you do know ‘A Tribute to Jack Johnson’ and especially ‘Dark Magus’, you’re in essentially the same territory here. This is the raunchiest and funkiest territory in the vast continent of Miles Davis’ unequalled musical legacy. It’s regrettable that no-one is taking risks in exploring unknown musical landscapes like this in the 21st century.of Miles Davis’ unequalled musical legacy.

ALEJANDRO ALMENARES BORN IN SANTIAGO DE CUBA IN 1937 IS THE LAST EXPONENT OF THE GENERATION OF CUBAN TROUBADORS FROM THE GOLDEN AGE OF TROVA FROM THE TWENTIES TO THE FIFTIES. HIS FATHER ANGEL ALMENARES WAS THE FOUNDER OF CUBAN TROVA. THIS CD CONTAINS TWO CDS, THE FIRST IS VOCAL AND CONTAINS 13 TRACKS OF SONES, BOLERO-SONES AND BOLEROS; THE SECOND CONTAINS 14 TRACKS, THE SAME SONGS BUT INSTRUMENTAL WITH FLUTE AND VIOLIN. THIS IS AN AUTHENTIC JEWEL AND IS A MUST FOR LOVERS  OF OLD CUBAN TROVA. THIS CD IS A ALSO A LIVELY PROOF THAT OUR TRADITIONAL SON IS STILL ALIVE IN SPITE OF THE HARSHNESS OF THE COMMUNIST TYRANNY AND THE INVASION OF THE FOREIGN MUSIC. IT IS A PITY THAT OUR LOCAL TV CHANNELS IN MIAMI WASTE SO MUCH TIME PRESENTING ALL THIS VULGARITY, DEPRAVITY, AND BANALITY OF THE RAPPERS,ROCKERS AMD REAGGUETON THAT DEGRADES AND LOWERS OUR CULTURE TO THE VERY BOTTON. IT IS TIME TO RESCUE OUR AUTHENTIC CUBAN MUSIC.  MUSIC,AND	2015-08-31

The artwork is excellent, and vaguely reminiscent of Roger Dean, which is perfectly appropriate.<br /><br />Recommended to anyone who appreciates creative hard rock and metal!	2015-08-31

Well, unfortunately I didn't care for it.  I don't even think I've listened to the entire album--stopping about 3/4's of the way.  I understand that all musicians need to explore and diversify and move on.  Unfortunately, in this case, I'm not keen on the direction the band took.  I honestly didn't find any song I would want to hear a second time.  Too bad.	2015-08-31

While best known for Fast Car from her self-titled first album, it only serves as a stepping stone for the artist. In New Beginning Chapman's voice has grown and her guitar work has not faulted a bit. Certainly her song Give Me One Reason is something just about anybody can wrap their head about and nod in agreement.<br /><br />Tracy Chapman has paid her dues. She can afford to make stretches in her ideas and work without sounding as if she's reaching for something unobtainable. In essence, she's right where she belongs.	2015-08-31

I simply cannot listen to Woman's Heart without crying, it is so poignant and lovely at the same time. Mary Black's voice is captivating. You won't regret getting this CD.<br />Here is a short quote from &#34;Only A Woman's Heart&#34; to give you a sense of this powerful album:<br />&#34;My heart is low,<br />My heart is so low,<br />As only a woman's heart can be,<br />as only a woman's heart can know.<br />The tears that drip,<br />From my bewildered eyes,<br />Taste of bittersweet romance.<br />You're still in my hopes you're still in my mind oh,<br />And even though I manage on my own,<br />My heart is low, my heart is so low...&#34;<br />The intertwining lace of Emily Lou Harris' and Mary Black's voices makes this song heartbreakingly beautiful.	2015-08-31

I have liked every song the first time I have listened to it. Except maybe &#34;Trust You&#34;, which is the least favorite of mine on the album though I still like it, though not as much as the other songs. I was a bit worried about the album because of that single, however I have seen him  release live versions of some of the other songs in concert on youtube, and I really liked those, so I had no hesitation of purchasing this album. The best song on the album is &#34;Pieces&#34;. The bonus songs on the Target version are very good also, of the two &#34;All the Best Things&#34; and &#34;Steady&#34; I like &#34;Steady&#34; the best.

So many fantastic potential titles to do: Alice in Wonderland, The Jungle Book, Peter Pan, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, more from the Disney parks, etc.<br /><br />Anyway, to the Disney Music Department I say PERFECT job on these titles.

This was a dream band with Chris Hillman,Stills, and some of country rocks (if you want to call it that I couldn't think of anything else) best session guys. The album starts off with a medley that I still play regularly even though it came out over 40 years ago. &#34;It Doesn't Matter, Johnny's Garden, Bound to Fall' are some of the best songs to come out of that era including CSN and CSNY. &#34;So Begins The Task&#34; might be in the top five greatest songs of the 70's. This album and these sessions went so good and sounded so good that Rolling Stone Bill Wyman tried to join the band (he does show up on &#34;The Love Gangster&#34; and &#34;Blues Man&#34; I wish they had stuck around or reformed from time to time like CSN. Stills did release &#34;Pieces&#34; a raw example at how good a band they could have been. Like Buffalo Springfield they died too soon, and Stills work on Buffalo Springfield,CSN,CSN&Y, and Manassas just shows how underrated this guy is. Solo is not his best option, but when he is in a band well there is none better.	2015-08-31

US	38214553	R13K914R4AWC8S	B00000088W	599174183	Precision: 60's Albuquerque Groups	Music	4	1	1	N	N	A 3-Star Collection For General Audiences - A Full 5 Stars For Specialty Collectors	The fact this Collectables volume has sat around since 1996 without so much as one review is a clear indication of the obscurity of the late 1960s artists covered, all from the same general area in New Mexico, not to mention the local labels for which they recorded, in some cases just the one single. Needless to say, none of the sides ever made any kind of impact on the national singles charts, especially considering the lack of promotional funding by the labels.<br /><br />So, as a collection, this will appeal more to the Pop music historian in general, or those collectors whose focus centres around artists calling New Mexico home, of which there were quite a few. For example, what you won’t see here is the instrumental group The King Pins (not the same gathering as that associated with King Curtis or the earlier 1960s group from Clarksdale, Mississippi) who recorded for yet another local label - Larse Records of Albuquerque - The Torques of Farmington, New Mexico who recorded for one of the labels involved here, Delta, and The Hooterville Trolley who cut sides for Lynette Records.<br /><br />The most recorded band in this set is the surf-rock instrumental gathering King Richard & The Knights who, from 1961 to 1964, consisted of lead guitarist Dick Stewart, rhythm guitarist Larry Longmire, bassists Gary Butler (1961-1962) and Gary Snow (1963-1964), and percussionist/drummer William &#34;Corky&#34; Anderson. Personnel changes and the addition of vocalists from 1965 to 1967 saw the same titled band comprised of lead guitarist/vocalist Dick Stewart, percussionists/drummers Les Bigby and Jack Paden, rhythm guitarist John Milligan who was replaced at some point by Dick Miller, bassist Jerry &#34;Toad&#34; Hutchins, keyboardist Mike Celenze, and lead vocalist/saxophonist Larry Reid. Along the way they cut sides for Delta Records, set up in Albuquerque by the John Wagner Studios, as well as Red Feather and Jyck Records.<br /><br />The band calling themselves The Plague cut their only single for the appropriately-named Epidemic Records (that was their only release as well), and consisted of former King Richards & The Knights drummer “Corky” Anderson along with Larry Shryock, Billy Main and Steve Erickson. Clearly, their “sound” was heavily influenced by the British Invasion band, The Kinks.  Another group that recorded briefly for Delta was The Era Of Sound which included brothers  Reynaldo and Michael Naranjo who also wrote both sides of their one release. Another one-release band were The Kreeg (guitarist/vocalist Robert J. Sturctman, lead guitarist Larry Ink, vocalist/bassist Hap Blackstock and drummer Russ Sturctman).<br /><br />Compiled for Collectables by Michael Greisman, the full contents, showing artists, time lengths, label details and year of release, are: I Don’t Need You (1:52) - King Richard & The Knights - Delta 2143 - 1966; 2.

Oh course, the masterpiece is the Blue Danube and under Karajan attention to detail is the norm.

I honestly thought I was dreaming when my #1 band of ALL TIME unveiled &#34;Immortalized&#34; and announced that their painfully long hiatus was over.  Disturbed has been such an influence to me over the years.  The first song I ever heard was &#34;Ten Thousand Fists&#34; and it was love at first sound.  There something about David Draiman's voice was simply captivating, it was aggressive yet refined and I have always felt that his lyrics are written from the heart. I have closely followed Disturbed ever since, owning every album and listening to every song and never growing weary of any of them.  Naturally, I was among the most depressed of their fans one they announced the hiatus 4 years ago. I pre-ordered the deluxe edition on day 1(after I had calmed down from the excitement of the album reveal.)<br /><br />Disturbed's return is even better than I had dreamed it would be, and oh have I dreamed about when they would reignite the fury that, for a decade, they had carried so well.  &#34;Immortalized&#34; feels like the logical sequel to Disturbed's last album, &#34;Asylum&#34; both lyrically and musically.  However, I did notice that quite a few tracks here pay homage to all of their previous works( i.e. &#34;Never Wrong&#34; sounds like it is from &#34;The Sickness&#34; while &#34;The Sound of Silence&#34; sounds like it could be a b-side from &#34;Believe&#34;).  I bet Disturbed did this on purpose and I am glad they did as they stayed true to their signature sound.  I can't pick a favorite track off Immortalized because all 16(counting the 3 bonus tracks) are just beautifully composed, although I shall name a few highlights,  &#34;Never Wrong&#34;, &#34;Legion of Monsters&#34;,&#34;You&#34;re Mine&#34;, &#34;Who Taught you how to Hate&#34;, &#34;The Brave and the Bold&#34;, and &#34;The Vengeful One.&#34;<br /><br />P.S. I don't get why people are upset about the song &#34;Fire it Up&#34; I think that Disturbed was simply having fun when they wrote it(it is an awesome song).wesome song).	2015-08-31

Even so, in some rare such cases there have been compilations emerge in CD format chronicling their efforts or, at the very least, multiple-artist compilations that included at least one of their sides. There is also usually some information available about them.<br /><br />Then there are those who, despite actually hitting some national listings, have fallen through the cracks with absolutely NO personal details nor CDs containing any of their music. One such are The Profiles, allegedly from the St. Louis area. Not only do we not know their names, we don’t even know how many were involved with the group!<br /><br />It would appear their first time on record came in 1966 with Musicland Records, a Minnesota label with distribution arrangements through the Amy-Mala-Bell concern - Windstorm (2:10) b/w Raindrops (2:13) as Musicland 20,004. A year later it seems they had the only release by the Louisville, Kentucky-based Big Russ Records - Cruelty In Motion (2:13) b/w You Can't Stop My Loving You (2:24) as Big Russ 4498.<br /><br />None of those graced any national charts, but in Sept-Oct 1968 they had the Andr&eacute; (Mr. Rhythm) Williams-produced If I Did’nt Love You (2:17) peak at # 30 R&B. And in case you’re wondering, that’s how “did’nt” was spelled on the label, which had Got To Be Your Lover (2:27) as the flipside of Duo 7749. I have no idea where that label was located (Chicago?).<br /><br />But I do know that their next stop, Gene Chandler’s Bamboo Records, was in St. Louis and there they recorded Got To Be Love (Something Stupid) (2:46) which topped out at # 43 R&B in April-May 1969 b/w You Don’t Care About Me (2:55) as Bamboo 104. The follow-up I Still Love You (2:30) b/w Be Careful (3:00) as Bamboo 108 failed to chart in June. It also appears that Bamboo 115 later that year also carried the hit side, but this time titled Got To Be Love (Or Something Stupid) and with a time-length of 2:55. Whether that was just a re-mix or a different cut is not known, but the B-side on this release was A Little Misunderstanding (3:25).<br /><br />So far, these widely scattered 45-rpm discs are the only source for anyone seeking their material, and when you listen to their efforts you will see that their talent deserved much greater commercial success.l-May 1969 b/w You Don’t Care About Me (2:55) as Bamboo 104.

They've turned into something more akin to a Bruce Springsteen tribute act than an actual rock band. The songwriters Jon's been using the past ten years are nothing but pop writers. The only thing keeping any semblance of rock in the band was Ritchie. Not only is he gone now, but his writing has been pushed away further and further with each release. The band is done. Jon has lost the magic. I understand bands need to grow, and add to their sound, so they don't become stale, but that can certainly be done with good taste, and done without robbing the sound that so many people loved for so many years. See Def Leppard.<br />This album itself is nothing more than a handful of leftover tracks that weren't good enough to make albums from Bounce through The Circle. And what a way to close the door. Throw out the rest of the trash. It even comes in what resembles a paper garbage bag.<br />I'll break it all down like this, if you liked BJ's first 6 or 7 albums, and maybe though Crush was a nice comeback, but have been waiting since then for the next These Days or Keep the Faith, you'll be sorely disappointed with this collection.<br />As for me, I'm done waiting. I gave them enough chances to release another album full of songs that I can at least call good. But I see now I've been waiting in vain. It went from a handful of good songs on Crush, to a few good songs on Bounce and Have a Nice Day, to a couple good songs on the next two, and down to maybe one good song on the last album, an NONE here. They're done. It's over.	2015-08-31

I love that they created it in secret.  I felt like it was all for me because I hate hearing about a new cd 6 months to a year before it comes out because I want it NOW!!! lol  I like that Disturbed have a signature sound.  It gets tiresome and less sincere with bands and pop stars that feel like they have to constantly reinvent themselves.  David still has the same look with the same awesome piercings and still no tattoos.  His lyrics are always relevant and intelligently written.  My only complaint is the he doesn’t showcase his singing voice enough.  It would be cool if he would do a side project similar to what Maynard did with APC.<br /><br />I love the chorus to who taught you how to hate.<br />“Tell me now, who taught you how to hate because it isn’t in your blood,<br />not a part of what you’re made.  So let this be understood,<br />somebody taught you how to hate, when you live this way you become<br />dead to everyone”	2015-08-31

(no, but thats what this CD sounds like!)	“Frankenstein’s Curse” by Michael D’Orazio is definitely NOT three chord pop! : Can you can picture a band with Phillip Glass, Frank Zappa, David Byrne, Tim Burton & Rob Zombie together?  Are you IN to hear what that might sound like as an album? Then this is music created for you! The subtitle for this CD should be “Frankenstein’s Curse” - A Guided Journey to Hell and Back. (It is an INTENSE listen!) Important Tip: The 15 tracks (70 minutes) are best experienced as movements in an overall composition! Do yourself a favor and be immersed in the sound. You can DO other things just clear your ears to hear this loud and clear. It is not everyones cup of tea.. but if your still reading it is probably for you!<br /> A roller coaster in a funhouse, with the first two tracks you are thrown right into hell’s Abyss. Instantly dragged into darkness, anger, madness, frustration and chaos.  In each of the remaining 13 songs, there is a beautifully woven theme that is reprized through out the piece in the lyrics, concepts, rhythms and melodies. In between each ‘movement’ Its almost like, with a twinkle in his eye..silently, he says ‘What do you think of that?.. Well let me show you more...” and your off in a new direction. Acceptance, humor, whimsey, beauty, compassion, wisdom & exotic mystery, all dance with chaos and madness. The instrumentation and arrangements invoke sound sculptures that illustrate these many aspects of the journey through the pit, back and forth from 'disturbed' to 'normalcy' with flashes of genius. Being driven into madness by life, (a woman) is not a new theme. But with his unique perspective, the musical vision and talent of Michael D’Orazio make “Frankenstein’s Curse” telling of that story a great listen!	2015-08-31

I first heard this album a few years after The Duke passed away and I love the underlying emotion and pride it conveys about America. I know America isn't perfect and there are things that need to change....but that's the whole point isn't it? To quote one of the songs, &#34;...to think our leaders might be wrong and to stand and tell them so. These are things that men in other lands will never know&#34;.  I lived if France and Switzerland for a couple of years. My roommates came and went, laughing at this album the first time they heard it, then asking to copy it before they moved on. The music is 70s style choruses, a bit cheesy,  but look past it and listen to the words, i think you will be glad you did.	2015-08-31

US	38214553	R1UJIE41A9US1E	B013Q7AUD0	472157463	Precision: 60's Albuquerque Groups by Various Artists (1996-09-24)	Music	4	1	1	N	N	A 3-Star Offering For General Audiences - A Full 5 Stars For Specialty Collectors	The fact this Collectables volume has sat around since 1996 without so much as one review is a clear indication of the obscurity of the late 1960s artists covered, all from the same general area in New Mexico, not to mention the local labels for which they recorded, in some cases just the one single. Needless to say, none of the sides ever made any kind of impact on the national singles charts, especially considering the lack of promotional funding by the labels.<br /><br />So, as a collection, this will appeal more to the Pop music historian in general, or those collectors whose focus centres around artists calling New Mexico home, of which there were quite a few. For example, what you won’t see here is the instrumental group The King Pins (not the same gathering as that associated with King Curtis or the earlier 1960s group from Clarksdale, Mississippi) who recorded for yet another local label - Larse Records of Albuquerque - The Torques of Farmington, New Mexico who recorded for one of the labels involved here, Delta, and The Hooterville Trolley who cut sides for Lynette Records.<br /><br />The most recorded band in this set is the surf-rock instrumental gathering King Richard & The Knights who, from 1961 to 1964, consisted of lead guitarist Dick Stewart, rhythm guitarist Larry Longmire, bassists Gary Butler (1961-1962) and Gary Snow (1963-1964), and percussionist/drummer William &#34;Corky&#34; Anderson. Personnel changes and the addition of vocalists from 1965 to 1967 saw the same titled band comprised of lead guitarist/vocalist Dick Stewart, percussionists/drummers Les Bigby and Jack Paden, rhythm guitarist John Milligan who was replaced at some point by Dick Miller, bassist Jerry &#34;Toad&#34; Hutchins, keyboardist Mike Celenze, and lead vocalist/saxophonist Larry Reid. Along the way they cut sides for Delta Records, set up in Albuquerque by the John Wagner Studios, as well as Red Feather and Jyck Records.<br /><br />The band calling themselves The Plague cut their only single for the appropriately-named Epidemic Records (that was their only release as well), and consisted of former King Richards & The Knights drummer “Corky” Anderson along with Larry Shryock, Billy Main and Steve Erickson. Clearly, their “sound” was heavily influenced by the British Invasion band, The Kinks.  Another group that recorded briefly for Delta was The Era Of Sound which included brothers  Reynaldo and Michael Naranjo who also wrote both sides of their one release. Another one-release band were The Kreeg (guitarist/vocalist Robert J. Sturctman, lead guitarist Larry Ink, vocalist/bassist Hap Blackstock and drummer Russ Sturctman).<br /><br />Compiled for Collectables by Michael Greisman, the full contents, showing artists, time lengths, label details and year of release, are: I Don’t Need You (1:52) - King Richard & The Knights - Delta 2143 - 1966; 2.

Leonard Cohen's music is something we can never have enough of. And this set is as much of a comprehensive compilation as we could expect today. In addition, the fact that it is the register of probably his last meeting with an Irish audience makes it even more special, a unique reward for the fans. Highly recommendable!

Picked this up on vinyl after months (yes, many months) of waiting for Amazon to get it in stock, only to discover that my copy had some manufacturing defects. Amazon quickly replaced the album, and believe me, it was SO worth the wait.<br /><br />Chances are, you're here intentionally and know exactly what the album itself is about, so I won't bore you with a track-by-track analysis.<br /><br />The mastering on this reissue brings so much more warmth and depth, it's jaw-droppingly good. Granted, it doesn't have nearly the charm of my exceedingly well-worn cassette from over 20 years ago, but it catapults back memories of driving back home on long, empty roads before the sun comes up, a million coffee shop moments, breakups, and makeouts with a vengeance.<br /><br />Even if Fade Into You is the only track you know, if it's got a special place in your heart, and you have a turntable, buying the 180-gram reissue is money very well spent.	2015-08-31

My first country album EVER, bought it on a whim after hearing a few seconds of &#34;High Time&#34;, so happy I gave it a try it's truly something different. Coming from someone who has never dabbled into country, this woman has an awesome voice, the songs are very happy and thoughtful and funny and beautiful, she herself is really cool (I've seen some interviews), and I believe whole-heartedly that this is the perfect music to play on a long car ride. Now when I hear the name Kacey Musgraves around Grammys season I'll be ahead of the game -- I'm a fan! Especially fond of &#34;Die Fun&#34;, &#34;Miserable&#34;, and &#34;Late to the Party&#34;,  that last one's a classic in my eyes!!	2015-08-31

Symphony X can do no wrong, every album packed chock full of amazing vocal lines, monstrous riffs, and incredibly well-phrased solos.

US	38192329	R10P9ZBJV9HOVL	B002KHNGE8	226043203	The Blues Of Eddie Boyd	Music	4	0	0	N	Y	A GOOD BLUES SINGER/PIANO PLAYER/WRITER IN THE POST-WAR  CHICAGO STYLE WHO DESERVES TO BE BETTER KNOWN!	This (67 1/2 minutes) album  was recorded in 1968 in Switzerland at two different venues.  Tracks 1-5 are previously unreleased (yes!) and tracks 6-17 were released on the Storyville label as &#34;Eddie Boyd-Live&#34;.  Boyd found Europe to his liking and moved there in the '60s, and this set has his first solo performances except for one previous  track on the Sonet label.  The sound is actually pretty good with a slight flatness to the sound--no doubt from the live recording techniques of the period.  The booklet has an informative essay on Boyd and his music.  This is somewhere between 3 and 4 &#34;stars&#34; but I 'm biased so I lean toward 4 &#34;stars&#34;--to each his own.<br /><br />Boyd (a personal favorite) has a natural swing in his vocals and in his piano style.  This set is a good example of authentic Chicago style piano blues.  Many of these tunes are in a medium/up tempo shuffle mode with Boyd's vocals out front.  He's best know for his song , &#34;Five Long Years&#34;, which has become a blues classic, along with a couple of other tunes which are also here.<br /><br />I first heard Boyd when he played with Peter Green and Fleetwood Mac way back in the late '60s.  Once I heard his voice and his piano I was hooked.  He recorded a couple of albums with Green, and a number of other English blues musicians that are well worth hearing.  But his strongest work was done in the '50s-'60s for several labels in the Chicago area.  Many  of these sides have just been reissued (&#34;Eddie Boyd Blue Monday Blues&#34;) and is a treasure chest of Chicago piano-based blues.<br /><br />But on this set Boyd is all alone and sings many of his own compositions which highlight his lyrics and arranging skills.  &#34;Five Long Years&#34; is here as is &#34;Early In The Morning&#34;, &#34;Third Degree&#34;, and other fine examples of his writing/playing/singing skills.  If you've heard his late '60s  work with Green you have some idea of how good a performer he is.  And here  all alone with his piano,  there's no real low points--he knows the blues and how to communicate it to an audience.<br /><br />Boyd never got the acclaim he should have during his hey-day except for his singles.  And when the late '60s British blues era was popular he never really came to the attention of blues fans then either.  and that's too bad.  Boyd was a prime example of Chicago piano blues.  His rolling, easy piano style and his knowing. pleading vocals, along with his song writing skills make him an unsung giant among Chicago blues piano performers.  Sadly this review will reach only a few blues fans, but hopefully someone will hear Boyd and wonder how they missed hearing him until now.ere's no real low points--he knows the blues and how to communicate it to an audience.

Nilsson," Windgassen; Bayreuth 1958	Music	4	2	2	N	N	A superb ""Tristan"" in good mono sound	The obvious advantage to this 1957 recording in comparison to the more widely known and celebrated live recording from 1966 with the same two principals is that the singers are considerably younger. This applies particularly to Windgassen", who, while he never really had the necessary heroic ring to his tenor to qualify as an absolute Heldentenor, sang with such stamina, sensitivity and intelligence that before Jon Vickers arrived on the Bayreuth scene and after Vinay reverted to baritone, he established himself as the foremost Wagnerian tenor of his era. Here he is somewhat sappier, easier up top and less inclined to tire so we are hearing him at his considerable best. I am not so convinced that Nilsson is heard to advantage here compared with her more mature self; there are bald patches in the middle of her voice when she sounds rather plaintive and even a tad whiny but the laser top was already in full working order and her sheer volume and heft are things of wonder. She is immediately so impressive in her ravings, when she curses the ship she is travelling in and she launches her top notes fearlessly.<br /><br />Some will also consider the presence in the pit of a young Sawallisch to present an advantage over the considerably more hectic and propulsive Karl B&ouml;hm in 1966. While I like the sheer excitement B&ouml;hm generates, Sawallisch creates more intensity and moulds phrases more tellingly; there is no lack of drive in the famous &#34;Telegramme Duet&#34; but his more leisurely approach is often preferable; hence this recording spills over onto four sides and begins with a swooning Prelude that lasts over twelve minutes. The orchestral playing is superb: sample the prelude in Act I to &#34;Herr Tristan trete nah&#34;, where the progression of massive chords is so dramatic.<br /><br />However, the supporting cast cannot measure up to that 1966, even if the little recorded but excellent tenor Walter Giesler is impressive as the Young Sailor and Fritz Uhl - later Nilsson's Tristan in a rather one-sided recording of the same opera under Solti - makes an impact as Melot. Grace Hoffmann is vocally very fine, her mezzo rich, steady and vibrant but her tone is also too often indistinguishable from that of Nilsson, whereas Christa Ludwig is a much more distinct character. Hans Hotter is grand but rather burly, effortful and a little clumsy as Kurwenal, sounding more grandfatherly, whereas Waechter is more the boyhood companion and retainer to Tristan. Arnold van Mill is grave noble and moving as King Mark but simply hasn't the vocal; depth and presence of Martti Talvela for B&ouml;hm; Talvela's Marke is simply shattering.<br /><br />Finally there is the consideration of sound. Here it is good, clear mono with excellent balance between voices and orchestra even if the former is slightly too favoured but there is considerably more coughing and scraping of those wooden chairs and at first you would swear that a herd of rampaging elephants is still taking their seats as the first notes strike up. Fortunately things soon settle down and apart from the occasional intrusive hack in quiet moments such as when the lovers have drunk the potion and realisation is dawning, it remains very acceptable.<br /><br />Thus, on balance, while I very much like this 1957 performance I do not actively prefer it to the later recording and I still turn to Vickers and Vinay for a more heroic Tristan.rather one-sided recording of the same opera under Solti - makes an impact as Melot.

You’d be hard pressed to think of anyone who’s done more to promote contemporary piano composition, particularly that in the “minimalist” vein, than the Dutch performer, Jeroen Van Veen. His protean efforts have yielded a wide range of voluminous recordings, all expertly performed in an exciting range of styles.<br /><br />It’s not surprising, then, that he’s used his encyclopedic knowledge to also create a 5-disc offering of his own compositions, all excellent and the whole collection a listening delight. While it’s hard to briefly comment on so many CD’s, suffice it to say that the first three discs are openly minimalist in their origins and are hypnotic in their appeal, some cuts meditative while others will want to make you get up and dance (yes, I did). The range is delicious, including some engaging uses of prepared pianos, carillon, tape and organ. The fourth disc takes off in some unexpected directions, including a fascinating essay on the four elements and one of my favorites, “Repeating History,” a thrilling mash-up of fragments of classical compositions to which minimalist music is indebted, knowingly or not, and all knitted together seamlessly with Van Veen’s compositional threads. The last CD is NLXL, inspired by the aerial photography of Holland by Karel Tomei. There’s a great video (viewable on YouTube) of Van Veen and his wife, Sandra, performing it with huge projections of the photos behind them. I find this format more effective for the piece and while the Van Veens use a wide range of interesting techniques to accompany their two pianos (including ambient sounds), some themes overstay their welcome a bit for me without the visuals.<br /><br />So, a LOT of music to enjoy from a composer/performer of great passions and a lively imagination. Definitely worth exploring!	2015-08-31

"US	47924228	R8NMPWSUPNMSK	B001ONSWOI	386415802	Wagner: Tristan & Isolde	Music	4	2	2	N	N	A superb ""Tristan"" in good mono sound	The obvious advantage to this 1957 recording in comparison to the more widely known and celebrated live recording from 1966 with the same two principals is that the singers are considerably younger. This applies particularly to Windgassen", who, while he never really had the necessary heroic ring to his tenor to qualify as an absolute Heldentenor, sang with such stamina, sensitivity and intelligence that before Jon Vickers arrived on the Bayreuth scene and after Vinay reverted to baritone, he established himself as the foremost Wagnerian tenor of his era. Here he is somewhat sappier, easier up top and less inclined to tire so we are hearing him at his considerable best. I am not so convinced that Nilsson is heard to advantage here compared with her more mature self; there are bald patches in the middle of her voice when she sounds rather plaintive and even a tad whiny but the laser top was already in full working order and her sheer volume and heft are things of wonder. She is immediately so impressive in her ravings, when she curses the ship she is travelling in and she launches her top notes fearlessly.<br /><br />Some will also consider the presence  in the pit of a young Sawallisch to present an advantage over the considerably more hectic and propulsive Karl B&ouml;hm in 1966. While I like the sheer excitement B&ouml;hm generates, Sawallisch creates more intensity and moulds phrases more tellingly; there is no lack of drive in the famous &#34;Telegramme Duet&#34; but his more leisurely approach is often preferable; hence this recording spills over onto four sides and begins with a swooning Prelude that lasts over twelve minutes. The orchestral playing is superb: sample the prelude in Act I to &#34;Herr Tristan trete nah&#34;, where the progression of massive chords is so dramatic.<br /><br />However, the supporting cast cannot measure up to that 1966, even if the little recorded but excellent tenor Walter Giesler is impressive as the Young Sailor and Fritz Uhl - later Nilsson's Tristan in a rather one-sided recording of the same opera under Solti - makes an impact as Melot. Grace Hoffmann is vocally very fine, her mezzo rich, steady and vibrant but her tone is also too often indistinguishable from that of Nilsson, whereas Christa Ludwig is a much more distinct character. Hans Hotter is grand but rather burly, effortful and a little clumsy as Kurwenal, sounding more grandfatherly, whereas Waechter is more the boyhood companion and retainer to Tristan. Arnold van Mill is grave noble and moving as King Mark but simply hasn't the vocal depth and presence of Martti Talvela for B&ouml;hm; Talvela's Marke is simply shattering.<br /><br />Finally there is the consideration of sound. Here it is good, clear mono with excellent balance between voices and orchestra even if the former is slightly too favoured but there is considerably more coughing and scraping of those wooden chairs and at first you would swear that a herd of rampaging elephants is still taking their seats as the first notes strike up. Fortunately things soon settle down and apart from the occasional intrusive hack in quiet moments such as when the lovers have drunk the potion and realisation is dawning, it remains very acceptable.<br /><br />Thus, on balance, while I very much like this 1957 performance I do not actively prefer it to the later recording and I still turn to Vickers and Vinay for a more heroic Tristan.rather one-sided recording of the same opera under Solti - makes an impact as Melot.
